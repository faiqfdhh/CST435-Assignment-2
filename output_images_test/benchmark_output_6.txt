PHASE 3B: STRATEGY COMPARISON & PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

Comparison at 8 workers:
Strategy             Speedup         Serial %        Amdahl Limit   
Pixel-Level          3.29           x 20.5           % 4.9x           
Image-Level          1.07           x 92.1           % 1.1x           
Task-Level           1.05           x 94.8           % 1.1x           

Recommendations:
  • Best theoretical ceiling: Pixel-Level (~4.9x max speedup)
  • Choose strategy with highest Amdahl limit for better long-term scaling
  • IPC overhead is the primary bottleneck for Python multiprocessing
  • Shared-memory systems (C/C++/Go) would show significantly better scaling
  • Task-level parallelism has higher callback overhead but independent task execution

================================================================================
PHASE 3C: PARADIGM COMPARISON (Multiprocessing vs Concurrent.Futures)
================================================================================

Pixel-Level:
  Multiprocessing:      3.29x speedup
  Concurrent.Futures:   3.46x speedup
  Difference: -4.9%
  → Nearly identical (same underlying pool mechanism)

Image-Level:
  Multiprocessing:      1.07x speedup
  Concurrent.Futures:   1.08x speedup
  Difference: -0.6%
  → Nearly identical (same underlying pool mechanism)

Task-Level:
  Multiprocessing:      1.05x speedup
  Concurrent.Futures:   1.11x speedup
  Difference: -5.2%
  → Concurrent.Futures performs better here

Key Trade-offs:
  Multiprocessing: Lower-level control, explicit pool management, apply_async callbacks
  Concurrent.Futures: Higher-level abstractions, cleaner API, as_completed() pattern
  Performance: <5% difference for CPU-bound tasks (both use process pools)
  Recommendation: Use concurrent.futures for new code (modern, pythonic)

================================================================================
PHASE 3D: THEORETICAL MODEL VALIDATION
================================================================================

Gustafson's Law (scaled problem size):
  Pixel-Level: p≈32.64% (if workload scaled with processors)
  Image-Level: p≈1.06% (if workload scaled with processors)
  Task-Level: p≈0.68% (if workload scaled with processors)

Validation Summary:
  ✓ No superlinear speedup observed (expected for Python)
  ✓ Efficiency degradation follows Amdahl's predictions
  ✓ Serial portions align with IPC overhead measurements
  ✓ Results consistent across both paradigms (validates implementation)
